Celestial Object Detection with AVR microprocessor

This project was developed for the Embedded Systems course of ECE-TUC. An AVR ATmega16L was programmed to control a CCTV base with 2 axis of
rotating (simulating a telescope base). The azimuth and elevation (over time) data of a specified celestial object is imported into the microcontroller, which controls the base in order to follow the path of the object in the sky.
